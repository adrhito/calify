- PRIVACY.md with comprehensive privacy policy
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Production build optimization

## Technical Achievements

### Bundle Size
- Total: 285.16 kB (production build)
- Meets goal of keeping bundle small

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode with no errors
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Type-safe messaging between popup and service worker
- ✅ Comprehensive Zod validation

### Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Swappable AI provider design
- Reusable component library
- Proper state management with persistence

## Testing Checklist

To verify the extension works correctly:

1. ✅ Load extension in Chrome developer mode
2. ⏳ Navigate to a webpage with event info → click extension → verify capture works
3. ⏳ Verify AI extracts structured event JSON with confidence levels
4. ⏳ Verify multiple events show selection cards
5. ⏳ Verify review screen displays all fields with confidence badges
6. ⏳ Verify edit form with date/time pickers, timezone, recurrence
7. ⏳ Verify Google Calendar import creates the event
8. ⏳ Verify success screen shows link to created event
9. ⏳ Close/reopen popup mid-flow → verify state is preserved
10. ⏳ Verify no screen captures persist in storage after extraction

## Known Limitations

1. **Icons**: Placeholder icons are used - proper icon assets should be created
2. **Recurrence UI**: Basic recurrence display only (no advanced recurrence editor)
3. **Reminder UI**: No dedicated reminder editor in the edit form
4. **Calendar Selection**: Defaults to primary calendar (no calendar picker in review flow)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Create Proper Icons**
   - Design 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 PNG icons
   - Replace placeholder icon files

2. **Testing**
   - Test with various websites (email clients, event pages, etc.)
   - Verify AI extraction accuracy
   - Test error scenarios

3. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Calendar picker in review screen
   - Advanced recurrence editor
   - Reminder editor
   - Event templates
   - Bulk import for multiple events

4. **Publishing**
   - Create Chrome Web Store listing
   - Prepare screenshots and promotional materials
   - Submit for review
